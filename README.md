### What will the application do?
*The Workout Tracker* will allow users to track the workouts they have completed and save new ones to their collection.
In the collection their able to see their most frequent workout they go on as well as the rating they give each one. 
Furthermore, if they are unsatisfied with a workout, they could edit the exercises on it or remove the workout entirely.



### Who is it for and why did I choose this as my project?
Despite being someone who enjoys working out , I had sometimes struggled to build the motivation to go to the gym. With
The Workout Tracker, it would help me see my progress in the gym and motivate me to keep working harder. Moreover, some
days I would not have the time for it and the application should help me pick out a shorter and more concise workout
for any day of the week. Therefore, The Workout Tracker is for those who need to see their potential and growth in the
gym to keep fueling them to invest in themselves.
